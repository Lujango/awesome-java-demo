### Bean Mapping

_Frameworks that ease bean mapping._

- [dOOv](https://github.com/doov-io/doov) - Provides fluent API for typesafe domain model validation and mapping. It uses annotations, code generation and a type safe DSL to make bean validation and mapping fast and easy.
- [Dozer](https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer) - Mapper that copies data from one object to another using annotations and API or XML configuration.
- [JMapper](https://github.com/jmapper-framework/jmapper-core) - Uses byte code manipulation for lightning-fast mapping. Supports annotations and API or XML configuration.
- [MapStruct](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct) - Code generator that simplifies mappings between different bean types, based on a convention-over-configuration approach.
- [ModelMapper](https://github.com/modelmapper/modelmapper) - Intelligent object mapping library that automatically maps objects to each other.
- [Orika](https://github.com/orika-mapper/orika) - JavaBean-mapping framework that recursively copies (among other capabilities) data from one object to another.
- [reMap](https://github.com/remondis-it/remap) - Lambda and method handle-based mapping which requires code and not annotations if objects have different names.
- [Selma](https://github.com/xebia-france/selma) - Annotation processor-based bean mapper.
